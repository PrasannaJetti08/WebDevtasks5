  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! 👋 I'm <strong>Prasanna</strong> from <strong>Visakhapatnam</strong>, currently pursuing my <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering</strong>.</p>

  <p>I'm passionate about web development and programming. I enjoy creating clean, user-friendly websites using <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>, and also have experience with <strong>PHP, Java, and C</strong>.</p>

  <p>Through this blog, I want to share my learning journey, coding tips, and beginner-friendly tutorials that helped me grow as a developer. My goal is to make technology easier and more accessible for everyone, especially students like me.</p>

  <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech tools, writing simple projects, and helping friends with their development doubts.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “The best way to learn is by doing — and sharing what you learn!”

  <p>Thanks for visiting my blog. Stay tuned for more posts on web development, project ideas, and student life in tech!</p>
